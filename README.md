# piano-java-fx

Written as part of my second year Software Architectures studies at the University of Salford. 

The brief was to create an interactive game using Java for primary school children.

The application allows users to:
  - Play varying keys on a colorful interactive piano
  - Change the sounds of the piano to 4 different sound settings including guitar
  - Play prexisting songs from a list of predifined melodies
  - View their progress using visually engaging graphs
  - Record their own melodies and play them back at a later date
